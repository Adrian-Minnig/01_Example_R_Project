# Notes from the second course day (Reproducibility and GitHub)
# File --> new File --> Quarto Document
# A File opens, which can be saved in the working directory
# We can switch between the "Source" mode and the "Visual" mode

# Quarto Markdown
# See also presentation and R-Script notes
# When creating a Quarto document, we can choose documents (HTML, docx, pdf) or
# presentations (RevealjS, Powerpoint etc) RevealjS is recommended for full
# functionality (The slides for this course were created like this)


# GitHub: This approach is used, when we already have a project and then
# we want to create a repository of this project

usethis::use_git()
usethis::use_github()
#run the usethis::usegit() command then chose the actions by tying (1,2 or 3 )
# in the console.
